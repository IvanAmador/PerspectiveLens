
Endpoints
News API has 2 main endpoints:

Everything /v2/everything – search every article published by over 150,000 different sources large and small in the last 5 years. This endpoint is ideal for news analysis and article discovery.
Top headlines /v2/top-headlines – returns breaking news headlines for countries, categories, and singular publishers. This is perfect for use with news tickers or anywhere you want to use live up-to-date news headlines.
There is also a minor endpoint that can be used to retrieve a small subset of the publishers we can scan:

Sources /v2/top-headlines/sources – returns information (including name, description, and category) about the most notable sources available for obtaining top headlines from. This list could be piped directly through to your users when showing them some of the options available.

Everything /v2/everything
Search through millions of articles from over 150,000 large and small news sources and blogs.

This endpoint suits article discovery and analysis.

Request parameters
apiKey
required
Your API key. Alternatively you can provide this via the X-Api-Key HTTP header.

q
Keywords or phrases to search for in the article title and body.

Advanced search is supported here:

Surround phrases with quotes (") for exact match.
Prepend words or phrases that must appear with a + symbol. Eg: +bitcoin
Prepend words that must not appear with a - symbol. Eg: -bitcoin
Alternatively you can use the AND / OR / NOT keywords, and optionally group these with parenthesis. Eg: crypto AND (ethereum OR litecoin) NOT bitcoin.
The complete value for q must be URL-encoded. Max length: 500 chars.

searchIn
The fields to restrict your q search to.

The possible options are:

title
description
content
Multiple options can be specified by separating them with a comma, for example: title,content.

Default: all fields are searched.
