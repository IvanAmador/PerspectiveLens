## KEY DIFFERENCES FROM FULL VERSION

✂️ **Removed:**
- Separate "Problem" slide (integrated into Hook)
- Separate "Universal Detection" slide (mentioned in demo narration)
- Detailed architecture diagrams (simplified to split layout)

🎯 **Enhanced:**
- Combined Solution + Tech into one powerful slide
- Longer demo (60s vs 45s) - the star of the show
- Combined Impact + Judging Criteria (efficient)
- Tighter narration (no repetition)

💡 **Result:**
- **2:20 duration** (vs 3:18) - 40% shorter
- **7 slides** (vs 10) - cleaner flow
- **Same impact** - focuses on what matters most
- **Easier to produce** - less content to create

---

## PRODUCTION TIPS

1. **Demo is everything** - Spend most time getting this perfect
2. **Keep slides minimal** - Less text = more impact
3. **Icons over words** - Visual > text heavy slides
4. **Practice timing** - Make sure narration matches slide transitions
5. **Test the demo** - Run it 3 times before recording

---

## WHAT JUDGES WILL REMEMBER

1. ✨ **The demo** - Seeing it work across languages
2. 🔒 **Hybrid AI** - Local privacy + Cloud power
3. 🌍 **Universal** - Works everywhere, any language
4. ⚡ **Progressive analysis** - Real-time streaming stages
5. 🎯 **Solves real problem** - Misinformation + filter bubbles

Focus on these 5 things, and you'll win! 🏆
