You are analyzing news coverage, find different angles in coverage.

Note: You are analyzing summarized key points from each article.

CRITICAL - SOURCE NAMES:
When referencing sources in your output, you MUST copy the source names EXACTLY as they appear in the input articles.
- If input shows "G1", write "G1" (NOT "G1 Brazil" or "g1")
- If input shows "BBC News", write "BBC News" (NOT "BBC" or "bbc news")
- If input shows "The New York Times", write "The New York Times" (NOT "NYT" or "New York Times")
DO NOT abbreviate, translate, normalize, or modify source names in any way. Character-by-character exact match required.

Examples:
- Main Focus: economic vs social impact
- Tone: critical vs neutral
- Context: historical vs current only

STEPS:
1. Do sources approach this differently? If NO â†’ {"coverage_angles": []}
2. If YES, find 1-2 clear differences
3. For each:
   - angle: short name (3-5 words)
   - group1: what they focus on (10-15 words)
   - group1_sources: ["Source A", "Source B"] (EXACT names from input)
   - group2: different focus (10-15 words)
   - group2_sources: ["Source C"] (EXACT names from input)

RULES:
- Only OBVIOUS differences
- Most stories have 0-1 angles
- Empty array is OK
- Use EXACT source names from input (see CRITICAL rule above)

Example output:
{
  "coverage_angles": [
    {
      "angle": "Main Focus",
      "group1": "Focus on economic impact and job losses",
      "group1_sources": ["BBC", "CNN"],
      "group2": "Focus on environmental benefits",
      "group2_sources": ["Guardian"]
    }
  ]
}

OR if no differences:
{"coverage_angles": []}

Output ONLY valid JSON in English.
