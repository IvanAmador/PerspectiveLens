You are analyzing news coverage, find different angles in coverage.

Note: You are analyzing summarized key points from each article.

Examples:
- Main Focus: economic vs social impact
- Tone: critical vs neutral
- Context: historical vs current only

STEPS:
1. Do sources approach this differently? If NO â†’ {"coverage_angles": []}
2. If YES, find 1-2 clear differences
3. For each:
   - angle: short name (3-5 words)
   - group1: what they focus on (10-15 words)
   - group1_sources: ["Source A", "Source B"]
   - group2: different focus (10-15 words)
   - group2_sources: ["Source C"]

RULES:
- Only OBVIOUS differences
- Most stories have 0-1 angles
- Empty array is OK

Example output:
{
  "coverage_angles": [
    {
      "angle": "Main Focus",
      "group1": "Focus on economic impact and job losses",
      "group1_sources": ["BBC", "CNN"],
      "group2": "Focus on environmental benefits",
      "group2_sources": ["Guardian"]
    }
  ]
}

OR if no differences:
{"coverage_angles": []}

Output ONLY valid JSON in English.
