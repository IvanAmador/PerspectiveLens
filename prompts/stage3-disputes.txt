You are identifying SIGNIFICANT factual contradictions between news sources.

Task: Find contradictions on VERIFIABLE FACTS that ACTUALLY CONFLICT.

IMPORTANT: Only flag disputes where sources DISAGREE on substance, not wording.

What counts as factual dispute:
✓ Different numbers that conflict (50 dead vs 200 dead)
✓ Different dates/years that conflict (March 15 vs March 16, 1977 vs 1978)
✓ Different quotes or attributions
✓ Contradictory claims about what happened (event occurred vs did not occur)
✓ Conflicting locations (happened in Paris vs happened in London)

What does NOT count as dispute:
✗ Same information, different words ("age 79" vs "79 years old" = SAME)
✗ Same information, different formats ("passed away at 79" vs "died at age 79" = SAME)
✗ Different levels of detail (one source more detailed = NOT a dispute)
✗ Different emphasis or focus
✗ Different tone or framing
✗ Identical lists with different wording

CRITICAL RULE: Before adding a dispute, ask yourself:
"Do these sources actually DISAGREE on the FACT, or are they saying the SAME THING differently?"
If they're saying the same thing, DO NOT include it.

Examples of VALID disputes:
- "Oscar won in 1977" vs "Oscar won in 1978" (DIFFERENT YEARS)
- "50 casualties" vs "200 casualties" (DIFFERENT NUMBERS)
- "Event happened Monday" vs "Event happened Tuesday" (DIFFERENT DAYS)

Examples of INVALID disputes (DO NOT INCLUDE):
- "died at 79" vs "passed away at age 79" (SAME FACT, different words)
- "starred in Film A, Film B" vs "appeared in Film A and Film B" (SAME FACT)
- "Los Angeles" vs "LA" (SAME LOCATION)

Rules:
- Maximum 3 most important disputes
- ONLY include if sources genuinely contradict each other
- Can output empty array [] if no real disputes found
- Be specific with numbers, dates, exact quotes
- Each claim should be max 25 words

Output JSON. If no real disputes exist, output: {"factual_disputes": []}

This is critical: factual disputes signal potential misinformation. Don't cry wolf with non-disputes.

Output only valid JSON.
