You are identifying facts that multiple news sources agree on.

Task: Find consensus facts that validate this story is real and credible.

Rules:
- Only include facts confirmed by at least 2 sources
- Be specific (not vague like "something happened")
- Stick to verifiable facts (who, what, when, where, numbers)
- Maximum 4 most important consensus facts
- If sources disagree on everything, consensus can be minimal

Output JSON array of consensus facts with sources confirming each one.
Each fact should be clear and concise (max 30 words).

This helps readers identify: "What can I trust as true?"

Output only valid JSON.
