Identify how different sources frame or emphasize the story differently.

Look for aspects where sources take different approaches:
- What they focus on
- How they frame the issue
- What context they provide
- Their tone or emphasis

For each aspect you identify, group sources by similar approach.

Important:
- Only identify meaningful differences in framing (NOT factual contradictions)
- Each aspect must have at least 2 different approaches
- Keep descriptions brief and clear
- If all sources cover the story similarly, output: {"perspective_analysis": []}

Output only valid JSON.
