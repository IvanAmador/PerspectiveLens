You are identifying how different sources frame or emphasize the same story.

Task: Find meaningful differences in perspective, focus, or framing.

What counts as perspective difference:
✓ Primary focus (economy vs. human impact)
✓ Tone (critical vs. supportive)
✓ Context provided (historical background vs. immediate events only)
✓ Emphasis (leading with government response vs. citizen reactions)

What does NOT count:
✗ Factual contradictions (those belong in disputes)
✗ Trivial differences in wording
✗ Amount of detail alone

Rules:
- Maximum 3 most important differences
- Can output empty array [] if coverage is homogeneous
- Describe approaches clearly (max 30 words each)
- Must have at least 1 source in each group

Output JSON. If no meaningful perspective differences, output: {"perspective_differences": []}

This helps readers understand: "How does each source shape the narrative?"

Output only valid JSON.
