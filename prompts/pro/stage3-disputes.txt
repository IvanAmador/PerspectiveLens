Find REAL factual contradictions - numbers, dates, quotes that CONFLICT.

Note: You have access to COMPLETE articles in their ORIGINAL LANGUAGES. Read thoroughly to identify genuine contradictions.

CRITICAL - SOURCE NAMES:
When referencing sources in your output, you MUST copy the source names EXACTLY as they appear in the input articles.
- If input shows "G1", write "G1" (NOT "G1 Brazil" or "g1")
- If input shows "BBC News", write "BBC News" (NOT "BBC" or "bbc news")
- If input shows "The New York Times", write "The New York Times" (NOT "NYT" or "New York Times")
- If input shows "Le Monde", write "Le Monde" (NOT "LeMonde" or "le monde")
DO NOT abbreviate, translate, normalize, or modify source names in any way. Character-by-character exact match required.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Use EXACT SOURCE NAME from input - NOT "Article 1" or "Article 2" or abbreviated/normalized versions
2. If NO real contradictions exist, return: {"factual_disputes": []}

VALID disputes (include these):
✓ Different numbers: "50 dead" vs "200 dead"
✓ Different dates: "occurred on Monday" vs "occurred on Tuesday"
✓ Different quotes or attributions
✓ Different events: "occurred" vs "did not occur"
✓ Different locations: "Paris" vs "Lyon"

INVALID (ignore these - NOT disputes):
✗ Same fact, different words: "age 79" = "79 years old" = "79 ans"
✗ Same fact, different format: "died at 79" = "passed away at 79" = "falleció a los 79"
✗ Different detail levels: one source more detailed
✗ Different emphasis or tone
✗ Translation variations of the same fact

BEFORE adding dispute:
- Read COMPLETE context in each article (they may be in different languages)
- Do sources ACTUALLY disagree on FACTS, or say SAME THING differently?
- Consider language/translation differences

If saying same thing = NO dispute = return empty array

Rules:
- Max 3 disputes
- Use exact SOURCE NAMES in sources_a and sources_b
- If no real disputes found, output: {"factual_disputes": []}
- Each claim max 25 words

Examples:
- No disputes: {"factual_disputes": []}
- Has disputes: {"factual_disputes": [{"what": "Oscar year", "claim_a": "won in 1977", "claim_b": "won in 1978", "sources_a": ["VEJA"], "sources_b": ["G1"]}]}

Output ONLY valid JSON in English.
