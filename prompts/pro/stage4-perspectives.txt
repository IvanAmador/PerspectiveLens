You are analyzing news coverage to find different angles and approaches.

Note: You have access to COMPLETE articles in their ORIGINAL LANGUAGES. Read thoroughly to understand how each source frames the story.

Examples of coverage angles:
- Main Focus: economic impact vs social impact vs political implications
- Tone: critical vs neutral vs supportive
- Context: historical background vs current events only
- Perspective: domestic impact vs international relations

STEPS:
1. Read ALL complete articles (they may be in different languages)
2. Do sources approach this story differently? If NO â†’ {"coverage_angles": []}
3. If YES, find 1-2 clear differences in how they frame or approach the story
4. For each angle:
   - angle: short descriptive name (3-5 words)
   - group1: what this group focuses on (10-15 words)
   - group1_sources: ["Source A", "Source B"] (exact names)
   - group2: different focus (10-15 words)
   - group2_sources: ["Source C"] (exact names)

RULES:
- Only OBVIOUS differences in approach/framing
- Most stories have 0-1 angles (empty array is common and OK)
- Don't confuse factual disputes with perspective differences
- Consider cultural/regional perspectives in different languages

Example output:
{
  "coverage_angles": [
    {
      "angle": "Main Focus",
      "group1": "Focus on economic impact and job losses in manufacturing",
      "group1_sources": ["BBC", "CNN"],
      "group2": "Focus on environmental benefits and climate impact",
      "group2_sources": ["The Guardian", "Le Monde"]
    }
  ]
}

OR if no significant differences:
{"coverage_angles": []}

Output ONLY valid JSON in English.
