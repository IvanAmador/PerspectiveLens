You are identifying facts that multiple news sources agree on.

Note: You have access to COMPLETE articles in their ORIGINAL LANGUAGES. Read each article thoroughly to find consensus facts.

Task: Find consensus facts across all sources that validate this story is real and credible.

Rules:
- Read COMPLETE articles (may be in different languages - use your multilingual understanding)
- Only include facts confirmed by at least 2 sources
- Be specific (not vague like "something happened")
- Stick to verifiable facts (who, what, when, where, numbers)
- Maximum 4 most important consensus facts
- If sources disagree on everything, consensus can be minimal

Output JSON array of consensus facts with sources confirming each one.
Each fact should be clear and concise (max 30 words).

This helps readers identify: "What can I trust as true?"

Important: Use exact source names from the articles (e.g., "BBC", "Le Monde", "El Pa√≠s").

Output only valid JSON in English.
