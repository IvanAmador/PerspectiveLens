# PerspectiveLens - Hackathon Presentation Script

**Total Duration:** 3 minutes 30 seconds
**Format:** Google Slides + Screen Recording + ElevenLabs Narration
**Target:** Chrome AI Challenge Judges

---

## SLIDE 1: VISUAL HOOK
**Duration:** 15 seconds

### Visual Content:
- **Background:** Dark gradient or solid dark blue (#1a237e)
- **Layout:** 2x2 grid showing 4 newspaper headlines
- **Headlines** (create as text boxes or screenshot headlines):
  - **Top Left - NYTimes (USA):** "Ukraine Forces Push Forward in Eastern Offensive"
  - **Top Right - RT News (Russia):** "NATO Aggression Continues Despite Peace Calls"
  - **Bottom Left - Xinhua (China):** "Western Powers Stall Peace Negotiations"
  - **Bottom Right - Folha (Brazil):** "Conflito Ucraniano Entra no Segundo Ano"
- **Center text (large):** "Same Event. Four Realities."
- **Design:** Add subtle borders around each headline, slight drop shadows

### Narration:
```
Same story. Four completely different realities. When you read news online, you're only seeing one perspective. But what if you could see them all? What if you could understand how the same event is portrayed across the globe, in seconds?
```

### Design Tips:
- Use Google Slides "Blank" layout
- Create 4 text boxes with newspaper-style fonts (Georgia or Times New Roman)
- Make "Same Event. Four Realities." stand out with larger font (48pt)
- Use contrasting colors for emphasis

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
**Duration:** 15 seconds

### Visual Content:
- **Title:** "The Problem We're Solving" (top, 44pt)
- **Layout:** 3 horizontal sections with icons and text
- **Section 1:**
  - Icon: 🔴 or use Insert > Icons > "bubble" (red color)
  - **Heading:** "Filter Bubbles"
  - **Text:** "Algorithms trap you in echo chambers"
- **Section 2:**
  - Icon: 🌐 or use Insert > Icons > "globe" with barrier
  - **Heading:** "Language Barriers"
  - **Text:** "Can't access international sources"
- **Section 3:**
  - Icon: ❓ or use Insert > Icons > "question mark"
  - **Heading:** "Missing Context"
  - **Text:** "No awareness of source bias and agendas"
- **Bottom Banner** (highlighted box):
  - Background: Orange/yellow (#FF6F00)
  - Text: "This requires LOCAL, PRIVATE AI processing"

### Narration:
```
Filter bubbles keep you locked in a single perspective. Language barriers block access to international sources. And there's no easy way to understand source bias. Solving this requires AI that's powerful, private, and works right in your browser.
```

### Design Tips:
- Use 3-column layout
- Each section: icon at top, heading below, text below that
- Make icons large (72pt)
- Bottom banner should span full width
- Use red/orange colors to convey "problem"

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

  - Text: "Read any news article"
- **Arrow:** Large right arrow (→)
- **Step 2:**
  - Icon: Extension icon or click cursor
  - Text: "1 Click → Analyze"
- **Arrow:** Large right arrow (→)

  - "First-ever comparative news analysis powered by Chrome Built-in AI"

### Narration:
```
Introducing PerspectiveLens. The first browser extension that uses Chrome's built-in AI to automatically analyze news from multiple international perspectives. You read an article, click analyze, and instantly see how the same story is covered across eight countries. It's that simple.
```

### Design Tips:
- Use Insert > Diagram > "Process" for the flow
- Blue/green color scheme (solution = positive)
- Make arrows bold and prominent
- Bottom tagline in accent color box
- Keep it clean and simple

```
PerspectiveLens uses a hybrid AI architecture. For maximum privacy, it can run entirely on-device using Chrome's Gemini Nano, with translation, summarization, and analysis happening locally at zero cost. For more complex analysis, it intelligently routes to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Flash, or Flash Lite in the cloud, with automatic fallback and progressive streaming. You get the best of both worlds: privacy when you need it, power when you want it.
```

### Design Tips:
- Use 2-column layout
- Left side: light blue background (#E3F2FD)
- Right side: light purple background (#F3E5F5)
- Use actual icons from Google Slides icon library
- Make badges with rounded rectangle shapes
- Center connector should overlap both columns slightly

## SLIDE 7: SCREEN RECORDING - FULL DEMO
**Duration:** 60 seconds

### What to Show (Screen Recording):

**Recording Setup:**
- Close all unnecessary tabs and windows
- Hide bookmarks bar (Ctrl+Shift+B)
- Set browser zoom to 100%
- Use 1920x1080 resolution
- Clear recording area - only browser visible

**Recording Sequence:**

1. **Start:** Open NYTimes article (any recent news story)
   - Wait 2 seconds
   - PerspectiveLens toast notification appears: "Article detected"

2. **Click "Analyze" button** on toast (around 5 second mark)

3. **Search Phase** (5-15 seconds):
   - Progress indicator appears
   - Country flags appear one by one: 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇧🇷 🇯🇵 🇩🇪 🇫🇷 🇮🇳 🇨🇳
   - Toast shows "Searching for perspectives..."

4. **Progressive Analysis** (15-45 seconds):
   - **Stage 1** appears: "Analyzing context & trust..." (wait 2-3s for completion)
   - **Stage 2** appears: "Finding consensus..." (wait 3-4s for completion)
   - **Stage 3** appears: "Identifying disputes..." (wait 3-5s for completion)
   - **Stage 4** appears: "Analyzing perspectives..." (wait 3-5s for completion)

5. **Final Results** (45-60 seconds):
   - Analysis panel appears on screen
   - Slowly scroll through:
     - Context & Trust section
     - Consensus section (show bullet points)
     - Factual Disputes section
     - Perspective Differences section
   - Hover over country flags in sources list
   - End recording

### Narration (Over Screen Recording):
```
I'm reading an article on the New York Times. PerspectiveLens automatically detects it and offers to analyze. With one click, it searches for the same story across eight countries—you can see the flags appearing as it finds articles from the US, UK, Brazil, Japan, and more.

Now watch as it performs progressive analysis using Chrome's built-in AI. Stage one: understanding the context and source credibility. Stage two: identifying facts all sources agree on. Stage three: finding direct contradictions between sources. And stage four: analyzing how different outlets frame the same events.

All of this is processed locally on my device. Zero latency, zero server costs, complete privacy.
```

### Recording Tips:
- **Practice 2-3 times before final recording**
- Use OBS Studio (free) or:
  - **Windows:** Xbox Game Bar (Win + G)
  - **Mac:** QuickTime (File > New Screen Recording)
- Keep cursor movements smooth and deliberate
- Don't rush - let each stage complete fully
- The progressive loading is a KEY FEATURE to showcase

### For Google Slides:
- Insert > Video > Upload the recording
- Set video to play automatically
- Full screen video (no slide content behind it)
